# Gamepad Hook

## What is this?

It's a library allowing other plugins to subscribe to receive gamepad input.
I believe input looks the same regardless of controller thanks to Steam,
but you'll additionally need a plugin to hook to the appropriate function and pass the input to subscribers.
i.e. [MHW Gamepad Hook]

### Library

To use the library, I recommend using CMake's `FetchContent`:

```CMake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(GamepadHook
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins.git
  GIT_TAG 710f81b26ffbc8272a1a71cf2229b8eec2535dca)

FetchContent_GetProperties(GamepadHook)
if(NOT GamepadHook_POPULATED)
  FetchContent_Populate(GamepadHook)
  add_subdirectory(${GamepadHook_SOURCE_DIR} ${GamepadHook_BINARY_DIR} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
endif()

target_link_libraries(MyDopeAFPlugin PRIVATE GamepadHook)
```

Alternatively, you could probably grab the headers and the lib file and dump it into your project.
I haven't tried it and I think the effort and cognitive overhead isn't really worth trying.
But you probably know what you're doing if you prefer this method.

## API

Add this to your includes:

```cpp
#include "gamepad.h"
#pragma comment(lib, "GamepadHook.lib")
```

_gamepad.h_ includes all of these that you may include individually if you prefer:

- [Button.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/Button.h): Defines an enum for button names (Currently only PS4 controller buttons, but matching buttons should work)
- [Buttons.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/Buttons.h): Defines a list of `GamepadInput` representing 1 button each. These can be combined by using bitwise OR. i.e.:

```cpp
auto btns = Buttons[Button::Circle] | Buttons[Button::Triangle]
```

- [GamepadInput.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/GamepadInput.h): Just a typedef for GamepadInput. It's an unsigned 32 bit integer. Each bit represents a button
- [GamepadInputHelper.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/GamepadInputHelper.h): A couple of helper functions
- [GamepadStruct.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/GamepadStruct.h): The Gamepad struct that's taken from memory every frame and callbacks accept as input
- [IGamepadDispatcher.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/IGamepadDispatcher.h): The dispatcher interface and `gamepad::GetDispatcher()` are here

### Subscribing

The Dispatcher will call all functions subscribed to recieve input every frame. You need to define a `void` function with a `const Gamepad&` parameter:

```cpp
void callback(const Gamepad& gamepad) { 
  // Do w/e with `gamepad` this frame (readonly)
}
```

This can also be an [std::function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function), i.e. a lambda, a curried function, a Callable...

Then you get the dispatcher from the dll and subscribe using your callback:

```cpp
  gamepad::GetDispatcher().registerCallback(&callback);
```

You can chain registering...

```cpp
  gamepad::GetDispatcher()
    .registerCallback(&callback0)
    .registerCallback(&callback1)
    .registerCallback(&callback2);
```

### Gamepad

The `Gamepad` struct should be self explanatory, but I think I should give some explanation for the fields.

`Gamepad.buttons`: This has the currently pressed buttons. Useful for doing something continuously while a button is held:

```cpp
(gamepad.buttons & btns) > 0
```

A helper function exists that does this for you. Look in [GamepadInputHelper.h](https://github.com/SupaStuff/MHW-GamepadPlugins/blob/master/GamepadHook/GamepadHeaders/GamepadInputHelper.h)

`Gamepad.buttonsJust{Pressed|Released}`: Similarly to buttons, these represent buttons that were just pressed/released this frame. Useful for doing something just once on press/release. Helpers exist for these.

`Gamepad.simultaneousButtons_NotFullyUnderstood_DoNotUse`: Doesn't behave consistently. Sometimes it will alternate between held buttons if they weren't pressed at the same time. But it's not a good indicator of anything.

`Gamepad.{left|right}Stick{X|Y}`: Ranges from -1.00 to +1.00, representing how much the sticks are tilted. Left and Down are negative. Sometimes they go past these bounds, though... Rotate from far X to far Y and you'll see.

`Gamepad.{left|right}StickMagnitude`: &Sqrt;(X<sup>2</sup> +Y<sup>2</sup>)

`Gamepad.{left|right}TriggerMagnitude`: Ranges from 0.00 to +1.00, representing how much the trigger is pressed down.

`Gamepad.pressDuration`: An array who's elements represent the time in seconds that a button has been held. The elements can be accessed with the enum `Button`:

```cpp
auto GS_Charge = Gamepad.pressDuration[Button::Triangle];
```
