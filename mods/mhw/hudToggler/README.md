# HUDToggler

## What is this?

It's an HUD Toggler. I've seen a few that exist, so it's not a new thing.
This one is a Stracker plugin, so it has direct access to memory
and it's hooked to the controller input listener/poller
so it checks for input every frame.

## Game Settings

I recommend going to **Game Settings->HUD Display** and setting everything to off.

## Limitations

- Currently only made for gamepads, but feel free to open a PR adding keyboard and mouse support
- Currently hard coded toggles. Will add settings eventually. See #4.
