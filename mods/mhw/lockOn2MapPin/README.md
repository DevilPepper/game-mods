# LockOn2MapPin

## What is this?

When you lock on to a monster (R3), your trailraider will not automatically track the monster.
This is because the map pin doesn't get placed on the map for you when you lock on.
This plugin will do that for you. Cycling lock on targets will now also cycle large monster map pins.

## Game Settings

- **Camera -> Target Settings**: "Large Monsters Only" (Required)
- **Camera -> Camera Style**: "Do Not Focus" (Recommended if you also don't like lock on)

It doesn't work correctly if "All Monsters" is selected for **Target Settings**. You gotta live with that.

## Know Limitation

The trailraider doesn't change it's target mid-ride,
so you have to get off and on again for it to pick up the change.
I might fix this eventually if possible, but it's not that important.
It's still better than opening the map to set a pin.
